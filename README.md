TheJustSlime brand is one that aims to make the world just a little lot better.
People make everything too confusing, 12 hour cycles were the worst way to measure time. And then we add time zones on top of that?
We need to step in, now.

Firstly, time zones are as made up as daylight savings.
We don't all stay up in the day, and the hours don't even reliably tell you when the sun sets.
Basically, the entire system is just silly.
Well, we can't claim ours is any less silly, but it aims to become less silly.


To begin with, "daytime hours".
They don't even tell us a reliable 'end of day' time.
The hottest/brightest point of the day is 3 PM for me!
THAT'S NOT MID-DAY.
The sun rises at 9 am but sets at 6 PM??
Why have 2 sets of time that split in the middle of the day, and not have 0:00 be when the bright time begins, and 12:00 be when it gets dark?
And then companies and school decide to fling your sleep rythm an hour off to preemptively adjust for a change?
BAD.     BAD.

Then, the weird math of it all.
Some parts of the world use 24 hour time, others use 12.
That on top of time zones mean you have to do 2 math problems just to know an online friend's schedule.

"oh it's just one math problem"
YEAH, I KNOW. OK.  ONE THAT 3 BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HAVE TO MAKE DAILY. MULTIPLE TIMES.
We could save so much time if we fix it now.
That doesn't even go into the 2 minutes that it takes for the back and forth of
"oh yeah I'll be online at 8."
"AM or PM?"
wait 2 minutes for them to see the message.
"PM"


So. The Slime Zone.
First, time zones, remove that. We're going on UTC. Universal time.
24 hours? Well, that's random arbitrary math.
20 hours it is.
because it's easy to subtract 10 to get SlAm (Slay-Em) and SlIm (Slee-em)
"Why still use AM/PM logic?"
So you can say you sleep in the SlIm, or you sleep in the SlAm, between, etc. And Everyone will know Roughly what time!

What does this mean for the distribution of minutes?
Well, minutes themselves are very vital for a lot of time keeping, so we can't alter them unfortunately.
But hours on the other hand are a lot less vital.
So each "hour" (rename pending) is 72 minutes.
This will be confusing at first but if we all try, it will become just as common as the current 60 minute system.

The future of soslimety rests in all of our hands for a slimpler future.
